## New features in VIM 8.0:
- Asynchronous I/O support, channels
- Jobs
- Timers
- Partials
- Lambda and Closure
- Packages
- New style tests
- Window IDs
- DirectX support
- GTK+ 3 support
- and [more](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/doc/version8.txt).

The difference between VIM and VI (for VIM version 8.0) you can find [here](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt).

You can also download a new version of VIM on the [official VIM site](http://www.vim.org/download.php).

I just updated my VIM, but I didn't have time to check all the new features. So, in the nearest future I'll write the overview of the most interesting ones.
